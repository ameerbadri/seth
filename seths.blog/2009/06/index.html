It is.</p><p>The second argument that makes no sense is, &quot;how will this new business model support the world as we know it today?&quot;</p><p>Who cares if it does? It is. It&#39;s happening. The world will change around it, because the world has no choice. I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s inconvenient, but it&#39;s true.</p><p>As I see &#39;free&#39;, there are two forces at work:</p><p>In an attention economy (like this one), marketers struggle for attention and if you don&#39;t have it, you lose. Free is a relatively cheap way to get attention (both at the start and then through viral techniques).</p><p>Second, in a digital economy with lots of players and lower barriers to entry, it&#39;s quite natural that the price will be lowered until it meets the incremental cost of making one more unit. If a brand can gain share by charging less, a rational player will.</p><p>Conde Nast (publisher of the <em>Wired</em> (Chris&#39;s magazine) and yes, the <em>New Yorker</em> (Malcolm&#39;s magazine)),&#0160; is going to go out of business long before you get sick, never mind die. So will newspapers printed on paper. They&#39;re going to disappear before you do. I&#39;m not wishing for this to happen, but by refusing to build new digital assets that matter, traditional publishers are forfeiting their future.</p><p>Magazines and newspapers were perfect businesses for a moment of time, but they wouldn&#39;t have worked in 1784, and they&#39;re not going to work very soon in the future either.</p><p>We&#39;re always going to need writers, but the business model of their platform is going to change.</p><p>People will pay for content <em>if</em> it is so unique they can&#39;t get it anywhere else, so fast they benefit from getting it before anyone else, or so related to their tribe that paying for it brings them closer to other people. We&#39;ll always be willing to pay for souvenirs of news, as well, things to go on a shelf or badges of honor to share.</p><p>People will not pay for by-the-book rewrites of news that belongs to all of us. People will not pay for yesterday&#39;s news, driven to our house, delivered a day late, static, without connection or comments or relevance. Why should we? A good book review on Amazon is more reliable and easier to find than a paid-for professional review that used to run in your local newspaper, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Like all dying industries, the old perfect businesses will whine, criticize, demonize and most of all, lobby for relief. It won&#39;t work. The big reason is simple:</p><p><em>In a world of free, everyone can play.</em></p><p>This is huge. When there are thousands of people writing about something, many will be willing to do it for free (like poets) and some of them might even be really good (like some poets). There is no poetry shortage.</p><p>The reason that we needed paid contributors before was that there was only economic room for a few magazines, a few TV channels, a few pottery stores, a few of everything. In world where there is room for anyone to present their work, anyone will present their work. Editors become ever more powerful and valued, while the need for attention grows so acute that free may even be considered expensive.</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s ironic that sometimes people pay money for my books (I view them as souvenirs of content you could get less conveniently and less organized for free online if you chose to). And it&#39;s ironic that I read Malcolm&#39;s review for free. And ironic that you can read Chris&#39;s arguments the most cogently by paying for them. [Update: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/the-free-debate">you can chime in here</a> and see what&#39;s being said around the web as well.]</p><p><strong>Neatness is for historians.</strong> For a long time, all the markets for attention-based goods are going to be messy, which means that there are going to be huge opportunities for people (like you?) able to get that most precisous asset (our attention) for free. At least for a while.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">June 30, 2009</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="21076"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">361</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2009/06/malcolm-is-wrong/&title=Malcolm is wrong"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Malcolm is wrong+https://seths.blog/2009/06/malcolm-is-wrong/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2009/06/malcolm-is-wrong/&title=Malcolm is wrong&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2009/06/malcolm-is-wrong/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/theres-always-room-for-jello/">There&#8217;s always room for Jello</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5tX" data-title="There&#8217;s always room for Jello"><p>This is one of the great cultural touchstone slogans of our era.

Probably not.</p><p>So, if there&#39;s time for an emergency (Jello), why isn&#39;t there time for brilliance, generosity or learning?</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date"></span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="21077"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">168</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2009/06/theres-always-room-for-jello/&title=There&#8217;s always room for Jello"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=There&#8217;s always room for Jello+https://seths.blog/2009/06/theres-always-room-for-jello/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2009/06/theres-always-room-for-jello/&title=There&#8217;s always room for Jello&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2009/06/theres-always-room-for-jello/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/how-to-be-a-book-packager/">How to be a packager</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5tY" data-title="How to be a packager"><p>For fifteen years, I was a book packager. It has nothing to do with packaging and a bit more to do with books, but it&#39;s a great gig and there are useful lessons, because there are dozens of industries just waiting for you to do something like this. Let me explain:</p><p>A book packager is like a movie producer, but for books. You invent an idea, find the content and the authors, find the publisher and manage the process. Book packagers make almanacs, illustrated books, series books for kids and the goofy one-off books you find at the cash register. I did everything from a line of almanacs to a book on spot and stain removal. It was terrific fun, and in a good year, a fine business. Along the way, I worked with just about every major publisher and created more than a hundred books. I packaged (with various levels of success) video games, college professors, Julia Robert&#39;s astrologer, an award-winning children&#39;s novelist, the Weekly World News, Kinko&#39;s and (almost) Craftsmen Tools.</p><p>I think there are real advantages to this model (and not just for books). Star Wars toys, for example, were created by a packager, and so are most big budget movies. Duncan Hines licensed his name to Roy Park, perhaps the most successful food packager of all time. Roy died of old age with more than half a billion dollars to his name thanks to all that cake mix.</p><p>First, the world needs packagers. Packagers that can find isolated assets and connect them in a way that creates value, at the same time that they put in the effort to actually ship the product out of the door.&#0160; Kaplan might never have gotten into the test prep book business if we hadn&#39;t done all the hard work of persuading them to enter the market (it took several years) and creating the books that launched their line. One series of books generated tens of thousands of new customers for them.</p><p>Second, in many industries there are &#39;publishers&#39; who need more products to sell. Any website with a lot of traffic and a shopping cart can benefit from someone who can assemble products that they can profitably sell. Apple uses the iPhone store to publish apps. It&#39;s not a perfect analogy, because they&#39;re not taking any financial risk, but the web is now creating a new sort of middleman who can cheaply sell a product to the end user. We also see this with Bed, Bath and Beyond commissioning products for their stores, or Trader Joe&#39;s doing it with food items.</p><p>Any time you can successfully bring together people who have a reputation or skill with people who sell things, you&#39;re creating value. If you find an appropriate scale, it can become a sustainable, profitable business.</p><p>The skills you bring to the table are vision, taste and a knack for seeing what&#39;s missing. You also have to be a project manager, a salesperson and the voice of reason, the person who brings the entire thing together and to market without it falling apart. Like so many of the businesses that are working now, it doesn&#39;t take much cash, it merely takes persistence and drive.</p><p>Here are some basic rules of thumb that I learned the hard way:</p><ol><li>It&#39;s much easier to sell to an industry that&#39;s used to buying. Books were a great place for me to start because book publishers are organized to buy projects from outsiders. It&#39;s hard enough to make the sale, way too hard to persuade the person that they should even consider entering the market. (PS stay away from the toy business).</li><li>Earning the trust of the industry is critical. The tenth sale is a thousand times easier than the second one (the first one doesn&#39;t count&#8230; beginner&#39;s luck).</li><li>Developing expertise or assets that are not easily copied is essential, otherwise you&#39;re just a middleman.</li><li>Patience in earning the confidence of your suppliers (writers, brands, factories, freelancers) pays off.</li><li>Don&#39;t overlook obvious connections. It may be obvious to you that Eddie Bauer should license its name and look to a car company, but it might not be to them.</li><li>Get it in writing. Before you package up an idea for sale to a company that can bring it to market, make sure that all the parties you&#39;re representing acknowledge your role on paper.</li><li>As the agent of change, you deserve the lion&#39;s share of the revenue, because you&#39;re doing most of the work and taking all of the risk. Agenting is a good gig, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.</li><li>Stick with it. There&#39;s a Dip and it&#39;s huge. Lots of people start doing things like this, and most of them give up fairly quickly. It might take three or five years before the industry starts to rely on you.</li><li>Work your way up. Don&#39;t start by trying to license the Transformers or Fergie. They won&#39;t trust a newbie and you wouldn&#39;t either.</li></ol></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">June 29, 2009</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="21078"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">432</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2009/06/how-to-be-a-book-packager/&title=How to be a packager"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=How to be a packager+https://seths.blog/2009/06/how-to-be-a-book-packager/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2009/06/how-to-be-a-book-packager/&title=How to be a packager&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2009/06/how-to-be-a-book-packager/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/the-paradox-of-the-middle-of-the-market/">The paradox of the middle of the market</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5tZ" data-title="The paradox of the middle of the market"><p>The middle of the market is the juicy part, where profit meets scale.</p><p>The paradox is that it&#39;s almost impossible to make a product or service for this segment, because they want the tried, the true and the boring.</p><p>A friend writes a blog and books for this market. They need his writing. He delivers a lot of value. And yet, it&#39;s going to take years (if ever) before he reaches them. That&#39;s because this market doesn&#39;t seek out new ideas, doesn&#39;t leave comments on blogs, doesn&#39;t spend a lot of time urging others to check out this new thing. He&#39;s spending all his focus on this market, and they&#39;re not repaying his focus with their attention.</p><p>The middle of the market is the home of Sinatra, Diamond, and Streisand. There&#39;s an endless list of others that would like to break in, but it rarely happens. The leading edge of the market is a lot smaller, but far easier to cater to, because those folks are looking and listening and talking. The middle will catch up, eventually, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to bet on them.</p><p>In my <a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/fast-in-fast-out/">post</a> yesterday, I talked about the temptation to merely pander to the geeks. It&#39;s not that difficult to write a blog, for example, that repeatedly shows up on Digg or Reddit. The thing is, this audience is fickle and they don&#39;t often convert into paying customers or long-term fans. It&#39;s not that difficult to be haute couture, to be fashionable, cutting edge or fickle. What&#39;s difficult is figuring out how to make it pay.</p><p>I&#39;m not talking about compromising or dumbing down your product. A very hot hot sauce is remarkable. A sort of hot one is boring, and no one, not even the geeks will talk about it. I&#39;m talking about designing products that are simultaneously remarkable <em>and</em> palatable to people in the middle of the market.</p><p>The middle of the market is a paradox because of the inherent contradiction between the ease of reaching the nerds and the geeks and the need to reach the middle. The solution, if there is one, is to enter a market to the enthusiastic cheers of those in search of the new, but to build a product/service that appeals to those in the middle. After the initial wave of enthusiasm, you hunker down and ignore those that first embraced you, obsessing instead on the needs and networks of the middle. It&#39;s a difficult balancing act, but it&#39;s the only one that works.</p><p>Ultimately, you end up disappointing the hard core that first found you, but because of their initial enthusiasm (and more important, because you designed your work for the masses in the first place), your product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1841120634/ref=sr_1_olp_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246122024&amp;sr=8-3">crosses</a> the chasm and reaches a larger group. The formula starts with a service or product that&#39;s purple enough to spread, but not so hyper-fashionable that it merely entertains the insiders.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">June 28, 2009</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="21079"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">226</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2009/06/the-paradox-of-the-middle-of-the-market/&title=The paradox of the middle of the market"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=The paradox of the middle of the market+https://seths.blog/2009/06/the-paradox-of-the-middle-of-the-market/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2009/06/the-paradox-of-the-middle-of-the-market/&title=The paradox of the middle of the market&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2009/06/the-paradox-of-the-middle-of-the-market/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/fast-in-fast-out/">Fast in, fast out</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5u0" data-title="Fast in, fast out"><p>Mark points us to<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news163333282.html"> this study</a> of fads and trends.</p><p>It turns out that a fast-growing trend is also likely to become a fast-fading trend.

A friend is someone who has interacted with you, or who knows your parents or reads your blog—someone with history. If you’ve made a promise to someone and then kept it, you’re a friend.

To tear down the barriers and raise the blinds on the way organizations do business and to expose as much as possible.</p><p>Does Apple become a more exciting or profitable company if they share their sketches, their plans, open source their new designs and engage the company fully? Does Steve Jobs have an obligation to tell his fanboys in advance that he’s fighting to stay healthy? One journalist says he does because it will help raise money for research, another says he does because it’s a public company, while many of his fans say he does because they demand to know.</p><p>What about the Star Trek sequel? Should we be able to read the script now, a year before they start filming?</p><p>Does a magician put on a better show if you know how his tricks are done? Do you want to see how your dinner was made, farm to plate? Really?</p><p>I look at the transparency issue not as a moral right, but as a business tactic, tool and threat.</p><p>1. If you run around acting like the things you do will never been seen in public, you’re going to get busted. Sooner or later, the marketplace is going to see the effects of your actions, and living as if this is certain makes it far more likely that you’ll find a happy ending.</p><p>2. Your job as a marketer is to tell a story, which is a lot like putting on a show. If you can use the tools of transparency to tell that story better, do it! But if your audience will enjoy the story more (and your business will be more likely to succeed) if you apply some misdirection and magic, then why not?</p><p>Radical transparency often excites people because of the radical part (it’s new! it’s scary!) than the transparent part. Playing poker with your cards face up on the table might get you some attention at first, but in the long run it’s unlikely to help you win a lot of hands.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">June 24, 2009</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="21084"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">80</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2009/06/magicians-sausage-makers-and-transparency/&title=Magicians, sausage makers and transparency"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Magicians, sausage makers and transparency+https://seths.blog/2009/06/magicians-sausage-makers-and-transparency/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2009/06/magicians-sausage-makers-and-transparency/&title=Magicians, sausage makers and transparency&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2009/06/magicians-sausage-makers-and-transparency/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2009/06/find-your-voice/">Find your voice</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5u5" data-title="Find your voice"><p>Marketing (in all its forms) is unlike everything else an organization does, because it&#39;s always different.
