Our paths have crossed before, we share a few friends, I&#39;m a big fan and he uses permission marketing to sell his records now. I said &quot;hi.&quot;</p><p>David&#39;s eyes flashed, he turned his shoulders, muttered something and rushed away.</p><p>What did I say? What did I do? Why he is upset with me?</p><p>Of course, David Byrne isn&#39;t angry with me. David Byrne doesn&#39;t even remember who I am. In fact, David Byrne was busy, or late, or trying to figure out where he was supposed to go next. The last thing he wanted to do was patiently spend a few minutes figuring out who I was and then a few more minutes making promises he wouldn&#39;t be able to keep.</p><p>The next time you&#39;re sure someone is angry with you, perhaps it&#39;s worth considering that you might be mistaken. Perhaps that customer or prospect or boss has better things to do than being angry with you. Each of us has a huge agenda, and while it&#39;s comforting for some to jump to the conclusion that we&#39;ve offended, it&#39;s far more likely that the person you&#39;re talking with merely has something else going on.</p><p>In a digital age, our cues for social or marketing missteps might be mistuned. Sometimes, believe it or not, it&#39;s not (always) about us. (On the other hand, and just as often, people are annoyed and don&#39;t have a clue&#8230;)</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">April 30, 2010</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="20697"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">153</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2010/04/david-byrne-is-angry-with-me/&title=David Byrne is angry with me"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=David Byrne is angry with me+https://seths.blog/2010/04/david-byrne-is-angry-with-me/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2010/04/david-byrne-is-angry-with-me/&title=David Byrne is angry with me&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2010/04/david-byrne-is-angry-with-me/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer/">The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5nQ" data-title="The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)"><p>For 400 years, higher education in the US has been on a roll. From Harvard asking Galileo to be a guest professor in the 1600s to millions tuning in to watch a team of unpaid athletes play another team of unpaid athletes in some college sporting event, the amount of time and money and prestige in the college world has been climbing.</p><p>I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s about to crash and burn. Here&#39;s how I&#39;m looking at it.</p><p><em>1. Most colleges are organized to give an average education to average students.</em></p><p>Pick up any college brochure or catalog. Delete the brand names and the map. Can you tell which school it is? While there are outliers (like <a href="http://www.sjca.edu/">St. Johns</a>, <a href="http://www.deepsprings.edu/daily">Deep Springs</a> or <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/">Full Sail</a>) most schools aren&#39;t really outliers. They are mass marketers.</p><p>Stop for a second and consider the impact of that choice. By emphasizing mass and sameness and rankings, colleges have changed their mission.</p><p>This works great in an industrial economy where we can&#39;t churn out standardized students fast enough and where the demand is huge because the premium earned by a college grad dwarfs the cost. But&#8230;</p><p><em><img alt="InflationTuitionMedicalGeneral1978to2008" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e201310f364a43970c  jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e201310f364a43970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" data-lazy-src="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e201310f364a43970c-320wi?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img alt="InflationTuitionMedicalGeneral1978to2008" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e201310f364a43970c " src="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e201310f364a43970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></noscript> 2. College has gotten expensive far faster than wages have gone up.</em></p><p>As a result, there are millions of people in very serious debt, debt so big it might take decades to repay. Word gets around. Won&#39;t get fooled again&#8230;</p><p>This leads to a crop of potential college students that can (and will) no longer just blindly go to the &#39;best&#39; school they get in to.</p><p><em>3. The definition of &#39;best&#39; is under siege.</em></p><p>Why do colleges send millions (!) of undifferentiated pieces of junk mail to high school students now? We will waive the admission fee! We have a one page application! Apply! This is some of the most amateur and bland direct mail I&#39;ve ever seen. Why do it?</p><p>Biggest reason: So the schools can reject more applicants. The more applicants they reject, the higher they rank in US News and other rankings. And thus the rush to game the rankings continues, which is a sign that the marketers in question (the colleges) are getting desperate for more than their fair share. Why bother making your education more useful if you can more easily make it <strong>appear</strong> to be more useful?</p><p><em>4. The correlation between a typical college degree and success is suspect.</em></p><p>College wasn&#39;t originally designed to merely be a continuation of high school (but with more binge drinking). In many places, though, that&#39;s what it has become. The data I&#39;m seeing shows that a degree (from one of those famous schools, with or without a football team) doesn&#39;t translate into significantly better career opportunities, a better job or more happiness than a degree from a cheaper institution.</p><p><em>5. Accreditation isn&#39;t the solution, it&#39;s the problem.</em></p><p>A lot of these ills are the result of uniform accreditation programs that have pushed high-cost, low-reward policies on institutions and rewarded schools that churn out young wanna-be professors instead of experiences that turn out leaders and problem-solvers.</p><p>Just as we&#39;re watching the disintegration of old-school marketers with mass market products, I think we&#39;re about to see significant cracks in old-school schools with mass market degrees.</p><p>Back before the digital revolution, access to information was an issue. The size of the library mattered. One reason to go to college was to get access. Today, that access is worth a lot less. The valuable things people take away from college are interactions with great minds (usually professors who actually teach and actually care) and non-class activities that shape them as people. The question I&#39;d ask: is the money that mass-marketing colleges are spending on marketing themselves and scaling themselves well spent? Are they organizing for changing lives or for ranking high? Does NYU have to get so much bigger? Why?</p><p>The solutions are obvious&#8230; there are tons of ways to get a cheap, liberal education, one that exposes you to the world, permits you to have significant interactions with people who matter and to learn to make a difference (start <a href="http://www.amazon.com/DIY-Edupunks-Edupreneurs-Transformation-Education/dp/1603582347/permissionmarket">here</a>). Most of these ways, though, aren&#39;t heavily marketed nor do they involve going to a tradition-steeped two-hundred-year old institution with a wrestling team. Things like gap years, research internships and entrepreneurial or social ventures after high school are opening doors for students who are eager to discover the new.</p><p>The only people who haven&#39;t gotten the memo are anxious helicopter parents, mass marketing colleges and traditional employers. And all three are waking up and facing new circumstances.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">April 29, 2010</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="20698"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">437</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer/&title=The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)+https://seths.blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer/&title=The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/carrying-capacity/">Carrying capacity</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5nR" data-title="Carrying capacity"><p>An organization with eight people in it might be happy, profitable and growing. The same business with twenty might be on the way to bankruptcy.</p><p>Ideas, markets, niches and causes have a natural scale. If you get it right, you can thrive for a long time. Overdo it and you stress the inputs.</p><p>The earth has a carrying capacity, certainly. It might change as a result of technology (we know how to grow food more efficiently than we did a century ago) but in any moment of time, there&#39;s a limit beyond which degradation kicks in. I don&#39;t think many would say that we currently have a people shortage. (Impossible to pull off, but worth considering: what if we skipped a growth cycle in the population and everyone in a generation had just two kids? Or even one&#8230;)</p><p>Your industry might have room for six or seven well-paid consultants, but when you try to scale up to 30 or 40 people on your team, you discover that it stresses the market&#39;s ability to pay.</p><p>Interesting note: there&#39;s also the common problem of under-staffing. More lawyers in a market might create more lawsuits. More effective ad vehicles certainly create more advertising. More lanes on the highway have been demonstrated to lead to more people commuting to work. Sometimes, adding capacity is exactly the right strategy if your goal is to add more revenue.</p><p>The next time you find your business struggling, take a minute to think about scale. More people (or fewer) might be the simplest way to solve your problem.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">April 28, 2010</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="20699"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">59</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2010/04/carrying-capacity/&title=Carrying capacity"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Carrying capacity+https://seths.blog/2010/04/carrying-capacity/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2010/04/carrying-capacity/&title=Carrying capacity&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2010/04/carrying-capacity/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h3 class="post-type-header"><a href="https://seths.blog/category/free-prize/" >Free Prize Inside</a></h3><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/transcript-of-the-first-linchpin-session/">Transcript of the first Linchpin session</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-6jc" data-title="Transcript of the first Linchpin session"><p class="MsoNormal">[transcribed by: TTE Transcripts Worldwide, Ltd. www.ttetranscripts.com]<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em>Sven was nice enough to transcribe this talk. The audio and other details are <a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/aprillinchpin/">here</a>.</em></p><p class="MsoNormal"><p class="MsoNormal">I was driving through a developing country in the Caribbean<br /> near the water, and I passed a device I’d never seen before, which is a<br /> gas-powered sugar cane juice extractor.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And it looks like one of those things they put trees in after a<br /> storm.<span>&#0160; </span>And they put sugar cane in<br /> and out the bottom comes sugar juice.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>So<br /> the question is, if you‘re the only guy on the island who has one of these<br /> machines, who has the power?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Obviously, you do.<span>&#0160; </span>The<br /> sugar cane growers have only two choices: grow sugar cane, or don’t grow sugar<br /> cane.<span>&#0160; </span>But if they grow sugar cane,<br /> they have to sell it to you because there’s nobody else who has the machine,<br /> which means that you will pay them as little as you can as long as they keep<br /> growing it.<span>&#0160; </span>And you will extract<br /> all the profit from selling that to the people who need it. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>Now,<br /> what happens when three new machines come to the island?<span>&#0160; </span>And now there are four people who have<br /> the sugar cane processing machine.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Who has the power?<span>&#0160; </span>The<br /> power has shifted, hasn’t it?<span>&#0160; </span>You<br /> have very little power.<span>&#0160; </span>You are a<br /> commodity processor.<span>&#0160; </span>The sugar<br /> cane growers still don’t have that much power because their choices are only<br /> grow it or don’t grow it, but the price they’re going to get is going to go up<br /> a bit, because other people can bid for it.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>But<br /> basically, the power mostly shifts to that consumer who doesn’t care which kind<br /> of sugar cane juice they buy, and so you’re going to have to sell it cheap if<br /> you want to get market share.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>Then<br /> one of the guys who has the machine stops making ordinary sugar cane<br /> juice.<span>&#0160; </span>He starts treating the<br /> growers better and encouraging them to not use pesticides.<span>&#0160; </span>Now his – he’s organic.<span>&#0160; </span>He starts treating the customers<br /> better, delivering more reliably in packaging that’s more suitable to what they<br /> need.<span>&#0160; </span>He invests all sorts of way<br /> to use sugar cane and process sugar cane and come up with clever sugar cane<br /> products.<span>&#0160; </span>He connects to people<br /> who buy sugar cane and the restaurateurs and the chefs and things so they can<br /> work with each other to do better stuff with his organic sugar cane and they<br /> pay more for it.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>Who<br /> wins now?<span>&#0160; </span>And the answer obviously<br /> is the customers, the organic growers, and the guy who’s an artist when it<br /> comes to using his machine.<span>&#0160; </span>As<br /> opposed to people who just say, “I just follow the manual.”<span>&#0160; </span>And the lesson, of course, is that now<br /> everybody has a sugar cane machine, that now, anybody who wants to make<br /> something over and over again, is going to be competing against other people<br /> who want to make something over and over again.<span>&#0160; </span>There is no competence shortage.<span>&#0160; </span>And if all you have is competence to offer, why on earth<br /> will we pay you extra?<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>So<br /> if you’re a machinist, making a widget that goes in a 747, congratulations for<br /> having a good union.<span>&#0160; </span>Both over<br /> time, intelligent people – capitalists – will buy that widget from someone who<br /> will sell it to them for one tenth of the price. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Because if all it is is a widget, just like every other<br /> widget, just buy the cheap one.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>They’re all the same.<span>&#0160; </span>If<br /> all you are is a replaceable cog in the system that makes the widgets, and<br /> there are a hundred people as competent as you around the world, you might get<br /> away from it for a little while, but you’re not going to get away with it in<br /> the long run.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>And<br /> that is the challenge.<span>&#0160; </span>So before<br /> we go into the six elements that I think we need to focus on when we’re<br /> teaching people about this, I want to talk about something that I saw – I<br /> visualized – just yesterday, that I help really help you see what a Potemkin<br /> village, what a façade we’ve been living in.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>Seven<br /> hundred years ago, no one was unemployed.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>The idea of being unemployed was totally alien. The idea of a job is<br /> pretty brand new.<span>&#0160; </span>And there are<br /> countries today where people don’t have jobs and don’t consider themselves<br /> unemployed.<span>&#0160; </span>That was put on<br /> us.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">How did that happen?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Here’s what happened.<span>&#0160; </span>Two<br /> hundred years ago, people invented machines – three hundred years ago, hundred<br /> and fifty years ago – the industrial age really kicked into power.<span>&#0160; </span>What he machine does is it allows the<br /> person who owns the machine – like the sugar cane processing machine – allows<br /> the person who owns the machine to get an enormous upside because it helps<br /> their productivity.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But if you own the machine, you know what you need?<span>&#0160; </span>You need people to run it.<span>&#0160; </span>And that means you need to sell the<br /> world on having a job.<span>&#0160; </span>And it<br /> turns out that wasn’t that easy.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Clay Shirky has talked about an author who’s pointed that<br /> gin was one of the key elements of the industrial revolution.<span>&#0160; </span>That two generations, thirty years,<br /> people were drunk all day long.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>That if you went to Manchester, England, you’d see all the guys working<br /> in the mills and you’d see a guy pushing a cart.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I have a picture of one – a guy pushing a cart that<br /> dispensed gin all day long.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Because this act of saying you have to go, move to a new place, walk<br /> into a dark building, spend 12 hours there doing what you’re told and then go<br /> home was alien. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">So you needed to have people to do jobs.<span>&#0160; </span>Why?<span>&#0160; </span>Why would you do a job?<span>&#0160; </span>I know, so you could have money.<span>&#0160; </span>What do you need money for?<span>&#0160; </span>So you can buy stuff.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>That was new, too.<span>&#0160; </span>Therefore,<br /> most people the act of buying stuff was not a thing you spent a lot of time<br /> thinking about or doing.<span>&#0160; </span>You had<br /> the things that you needed and every once in a while you’d have to fix them or<br /> replace them, but you didn’t go to the mall on Saturday.<span>&#0160; </span>That was all brand new.<span>&#0160; </span>That was invented by the people who had<br /> factors that made stuff that they wanted to sell you.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Why buy stuff?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Peer pressure.<span>&#0160; </span>Keeping up<br /> with the Joneses.<span>&#0160; </span>That once people<br /> around you have stuff, you want more stuff. And if you look at charts of<br /> happiness by culture, we see that there’s no correlation between stuff and<br /> happiness.<span>&#0160; </span>In fact, there’s a<br /> reverse correlation because if lots of people in your culture have stuff, you<br /> might be unhappy because you don’t have as much stuff as they do.<span>&#0160; </span>Apologies to George Carlin. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">It gets even worse because sometimes someone who might be<br /> working would say, “I have enough stuff.”<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And they’d stop working.<span>&#0160; </span>So<br /> you know what we invented?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Debt.<span>&#0160; </span>Debt has two really<br /> good uses when you’re talking about consumers.<span>&#0160; </span>Use number one is that you can sell people more stuff when<br /> they don’t even have money.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Use number two is once they buy the stuff, they have to go<br /> to work because otherwise, debt will take all the stuff away.<span>&#0160; </span>So that amplifies it even further,<br /> which leads to more compliance, more people doing the job, so that the factory<br /> the machines works better, and then to cap it all off, we have school. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And school is 12 years of publically-financed brainwashing<br /> to teach people to be compliant to get them really good at taking notes, really<br /> good at following instructions, and in fact, when you get to work – and this is<br /> important – when you get to work, pretty much the only skill you use that you<br /> learned at school is compliance.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>You don’t use geometry, you don’t use conjugating verbs in Latin – go<br /> down the list of all the things you spent all those hours working on in school<br /> – you don’t use any of them.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">What you use is you got really good at being compliant and<br /> doing a job – at doing your work because &#8211; that doing your job – because they<br /> told you you have to do it.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Okay.<span>&#0160; </span>So this<br /> system got put into place.<span>&#0160; </span>And now<br /> people are showing up, people like me, and we’re saying, “Wait a minute, Jerry<br /> Weintraub is the future, not that person on American Airlines.”<span>&#0160; </span>We don’t have a compliance shortage.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The United States isn’t struggling economically lately<br /> because we’re not obedient enough.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>The reason for the struggle is there aren’t enough people acting like<br /> Jerry Weintraub.<span>&#0160; </span>There aren’t<br /> enough people who are looking at a situation where there is no map, where there<br /> is no way to know for sure what to do next and doing things that matter.<span>&#0160; </span>Why is that?<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Aside from the brainwashing, aside from the debt, aside from<br /> the system, I think a big reason is the following: you’re not as good as you<br /> think you are.<span>&#0160; </span>When I say that to<br /> you – you’re not as good as you think you are – my guess is that if you’re a<br /> breathing human being, I struck a nerve.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>No one wants to be told that.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And in fact, I didn’t say it to you, I said it in quotes.<span>&#0160; </span>Someone else was saying that to<br /> you.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We live in fear – petrified &#8211; that someone’s going to say to<br /> us, “You know what, Bob/Jack/Jill/Sue?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>You’re not as good as you think you are.<span>&#0160; </span>Who do you think you are, acting like this?<span>&#0160; </span>Who gave you the authority?<span>&#0160; </span>Who gave you the permission to go do<br /> that thing that’s not written down?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Where’s your deniability?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Where’s you excuse?<span>&#0160; </span>How can<br /> you possibly justify what you did?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>You’re not nearly as good as you think you are.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But no one ever says that to us.<span>&#0160; </span>We just worry that they’re going to say that.<span>&#0160; </span>And the worry gets amplified by school,<br /> by spouses, by in-laws, by debt, by the system, by the media – that’s what<br /> we’re worried about because it’s brought out large.<span>&#0160; </span>Someone does some small misbehavior during a speech during<br /> the Academy Awards and we go, “Oh my God, that could’ve been me, everyone<br /> would’ve made fun of me.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Okay, so let me talk about the six reasons why I think this<br /> is hard for people and what we need to do to train them to think about it.<span>&#0160; </span>The first one – the one I’ve sort of<br /> warmed up with so far today – is they don’t necessarily understand what’s at<br /> stake.<span>&#0160; </span>That I needed to spend half<br /> the book – the first of Linchpin – explaining the change.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I couldn’t just say “that’s a given” in one page and spend<br /> the rest of the book on the other stuff.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Because if we don’t make it clear to people what’s at stake, if it’s not<br /> more scary to ignore that than to ignore the current fear, we’ll just live with<br /> the current fear, thanks very much, the current fear’s just fine with me.<span>&#0160; </span>That change often gets made when we see<br /> that what was on the table matters. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The second thing is the entire capitalist system I described<br /> to you does not include the word generosity.<span>&#0160; </span>The mindset of generosity is “I need to give something to<br /> someone and get nothing in return.”<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>We don’t teach very much of that.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>We don’t have very many examples of people who are good at that.<span>&#0160; </span>We are not trained to do that, but you<br /> can’t do the work that I’m talking about unless you’re prepared to be generous.<span>&#0160; </span>Generous is spirit, generous in<br /> substance, generous in behavior, generous in the way you’re sharing your<br /> heart.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The third thing is recognizing that anyone can do this.<span>&#0160; </span>Because the lizard brain – the voice in<br /> the back of our head – might say that some people can do it, but you<br /> can’t.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s really good at saying<br /> that and there’s a good reason for it because if you believe you can’t do it,<br /> you’re not on the hook to do it, and if you’re not on the hook to do it, you’re<br /> safe.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Smart people have a really hard time with this.<span>&#0160; </span>Some of the email I’ve been getting is<br /> stunning to me.<span>&#0160; </span>“Are you saying”<br /> they say, “that anyone is capable of having a ____ idea?” – whatever one<br /> they’re talking about – “are you saying that it doesn’t matter what country<br /> you’re from or what race you are or what your parents did for a living, that<br /> it’s possible to do original, interesting, generous work?”<span>&#0160; </span>Yes, I am.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">No, there’s no chance I will ever be a professional ping<br /> pong player.<span>&#0160; </span>Or golfer or cricket<br /> player or even be good at spreadsheets because it’s too late.<span>&#0160; </span>But I’m also saying that when you were<br /> four, you did something amazing that was an act of genius that no one had ever<br /> done before.<span>&#0160; </span>And when you were six<br /> or even eight you did it.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But then somewhere along the way, you decided that people<br /> might say you don’t have the right to do that.<span>&#0160; </span>Or they might laugh at your or they might say that you did<br /> it wrong and bad things happen.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And it’s easier to just not undo it because all the other parts of the<br /> system – the debt and the school and the compliance and the factor and the job<br /> and the business school and the resume and the HR people – have reinforced this<br /> model that says your job is to do your job and we have no problem at all<br /> rewarding people for doing their job.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We try to reward them with money because it’s safer and less<br /> personal.<span>&#0160; </span>But we don’t have any<br /> real problem with it.<span>&#0160; </span>And when we<br /> start talking about rewarding people for getting in touch with the fact that<br /> they’re actually a genius, it starts feeling really touchy feely.<span>&#0160; </span>That didn’t use to be that way.<span>&#0160; </span>But we invented this whole construct on<br /> top of it.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The next one is acknowledging the fact that you have a<br /> lizard brain.<span>&#0160; </span>A physical part of<br /> your brain whose job it is to make you scared.<span>&#0160; </span>Whose job it is to have you back off.<span>&#0160; </span>A Steve Pressfield calls it, “the<br /> resistance.”<span>&#0160; </span>The voice of the<br /> lizard is the resistance.<span>&#0160; </span>It is<br /> real; we can see it on a functional MRI scan of the brain.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">It is not difficult at all to trigger.<span>&#0160; </span>There’s a lot of thinking about what we<br /> do when it gets triggered, but one thing I will tell you is it always tastes<br /> the same.<span>&#0160; </span>It always feels the<br /> same. There may be a thousand reasons the resistance doesn’t want to do<br /> something – there may be a hundred things the lizard brain doesn’t want you to<br /> do – but it doesn’t have a large vocabulary, so when any of them show up, it<br /> always feels the same.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">It doesn’t matter if you’re a shy person, whether you’re<br /> about to meet a really important executive or just someone at a cocktail party<br /> – the same feeling is in the back of your head about what could go wrong.<span>&#0160; </span>That’s proof that this cycle is there –<br /> it’s organic, it’s real.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We have to acknowledge it and figure out what we’re going to<br /> do about it as opposed to just pretending that there’s this little man in our<br /> head who makes all the decisions because if we’re going to be in charge of what<br /> we do next, we’re going to have to understand the geometry of that. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Two more.<span>&#0160; </span>Steve<br /> also gave me this great expression called “turning pro.”<span>&#0160; </span>What that means is that there’s a<br /> difference between amateurs who are muddling their way through, doing what they<br /> feel like, looking for inspiration, and maybe doing good work.<span>&#0160; </span>And professionals who show up and do<br /> the work.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#0160;</span>pro golfer<br /> practices even if it’s cold and rainy.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>A pro psychologist is able to empathize with a patient even when they<br /> don’t feel like it.<span>&#0160; </span>That a pro<br /> trainer or coach is able to do the work and have the difficult conversation<br /> because it’s their job.<span>&#0160; </span>When we<br /> start taking it seriously – when we treat that job the way we treat our current<br /> job – we discover we’re capable of doing a lot of things that we tended to<br /> avoid because we made it easy for the resistance.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We made it easy for the lizard to not let us do those things<br /> because it’s just a hobby -well, it’s just a bonus – it’s an extra, it’s a<br /> thing on top.<span>&#0160; </span>I have deniability,<br /> I don’t have to redesign the packaging, it was the ad agency’s fault, I’ve only<br /> been here 12 weeks, spare, part-time, don’t worry about it.<span>&#0160; </span>But if you’re a pro, then we get to the<br /> sixth thing which is your ship. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And we can talk about shipping the entire day if you want<br /> to.<span>&#0160; </span>But the act of shipping it out<br /> the door, of hitting publish, of sending in the proposal, of actually closing<br /> the funding for your company, of having that meeting with your boss, of doing<br /> the difficult conversation – the act of making a product or service that people<br /> choose to talk about – shipping it out the door is what we have a scarcity<br /> of.<span>&#0160; </span>That’s what we have a shortage<br /> of, not compliance, but of people who will do the difficult work of<br /> shipping.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And it’s easy if you’ve done 11 editions of that Sunday<br /> school reader.<span>&#0160; </span>To do the 12th<br /> edition, that doesn’t count as shipping.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>That’s just a revision.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>That’s just doing your job.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>What I’m talking about is putting something out the door that people<br /> might not like.<span>&#0160; </span>And there are<br /> three reasons you might not choose to ship.<span>&#0160; </span>And the order is important.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Reason number one is fear, and we’ve talked about that.<span>&#0160; </span>Reason number two is using the Buddhist<br /> term “prajna” you might not be able to have an understanding of the world as it<br /> is.<span>&#0160; </span>You might not be able to see<br /> the situation in front of you clearly, and so you’ll do the wrong things to get<br /> it out the door.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And the third reason is maybe you don’t have enough skill to<br /> do it well, but the order is important.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Because all we focus on is the skill.<span>&#0160; </span>We don’t focus on the first two.<span>&#0160; </span>Let’s pick copyrighting for an example.<span>&#0160; </span>All of us are fairly verbal.<span>&#0160; </span>We can speak clearly for 20, 30, 40<br /> minutes in a row without notes if we’re having a conversation with a friend. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And yet, when the boss says, “Write two paragraphs that<br /> explain what we do for a living”, panic sets in, right?<span>&#0160; </span>And we start reading all these blogs<br /> and books and &#8230; conversations, “Well, I’m bad at copyrighting, I’m just not a<br /> good writer.”<span>&#0160; </span>Yes, but you’re a<br /> good talker, what happened in between the talking and the writing?<span>&#0160; </span>Is it that you don’t know how to hold a<br /> pencil?<span>&#0160; </span>That you don’t know how to<br /> type?<span>&#0160; </span>I don’t think so.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The two reasons you might not actually be able to ship that<br /> paragraph back to your boss is one, you’re afraid that the boss might look you<br /> in the eye and say, “How dare you, this is terrible.”<span>&#0160; </span>Or two, you might not be able to see the world accurately<br /> and accurately express what it is you need to say.<span>&#0160; </span>But if you did see the world accurately, and you weren’t<br /> afraid, this is a two-minute assignment.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>But you learned in second grade not to treat it like that.<span>&#0160; </span>In second grade you learned that when<br /> you have to hand in that homework assignment it might come back with red marks<br /> all over it and it’s not going to lead to much upside but it could lead to a<br /> lot of downside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">So I guess what happens is there are some people if you give<br /> them a mile, they’re going to take an inch.<span>&#0160; </span>If you give people this opportunity to do that art, to make<br /> that change happen, to have an impact, they’ll figure out how to minimize<br /> it.<span>&#0160; </span>They’ll figure out how to make<br /> it a smaller opportunity.<span>&#0160; </span>They’ll<br /> figure out how to look for less.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Why on each would we choose to do that?<span>&#0160; </span>The answer seems pretty simple.<span>&#0160; </span>The answer is because it’s safer.<span>&#0160; </span>The answer is because in the short run,<br /> making, as Zig Ziglar would say, the frying pan smaller lowers the bar on the<br /> size of the fish you need to catch.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And this is why so many people who call themselves entrepreneurs really<br /> aren’t.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">This is why it’s so difficult for somebody to start a<br /> business that really grows.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s<br /> why every time you look at a 6-year-old or an 8-year-old or a 12-year-old, what<br /> we’re seeing is someone whose been trained over and over and over again to push<br /> for smaller assignments, to figure out how to hand stuff in at the very last<br /> minute.<span>&#0160; </span>To whenever possible, go<br /> for the inch instead of the mile.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Because the mile is the scary part.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Let me shift gears here for just a minute.<span>&#0160; </span>And I want to talk instead of economics<br /> and I want to talk a little bit about joy.<span>&#0160; </span>And I want to talk about what is it that you do that you<br /> love?<span>&#0160; </span>I think we can agree that<br /> what we like is to go to work, do our job, get a pat on the back and go<br /> home.<span>&#0160; </span>We’ve been trained to like<br /> that and a lot of people like it.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But what do we love?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>What are the things that we do during the day that we actually love to<br /> do?<span>&#0160; </span>That we’re going to remember a<br /> week or a month or a year later?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Is there anything wrong with getting money for doing the things that you<br /> love?<span>&#0160; </span>Does it corrupt it if you’re<br /> getting paid to do it?<span>&#0160; </span>And is<br /> there enough money so that you could be bought off to do not things that you<br /> love?<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And when we have this thing of art connecting with this<br /> thing of commerce, we get really confused.<span>&#0160; </span>We get really confused because money isn’t just this<br /> paper.<span>&#0160; </span>Money stands for an<br /> enormous amount in our lives.<span>&#0160; </span>And<br /> when we can sacrifice our art for what we think is a safe opportunity to have<br /> money, so often that’s exactly what we do. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Whereas if you find somebody like Spike Lee who lived on<br /> macaroni and cheese and credit cards for years instead of doing what he was<br /> supposed to after film school, by lowering his need for money, he raised his<br /> ability to do art.<span>&#0160; </span>And ever since<br /> then, he’s been able to do what he wanted to do instead of doing what he had to<br /> do.<span>&#0160; </span>So he paid this price in terms<br /> of security, in terms of fitting in.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And in exchange, he got to do the work that he wanted to.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">You’re going to have to make a choice.<span>&#0160; </span>Your clients are going to have to make<br /> a choice.<span>&#0160; </span>Your team is going to<br /> have to make a choice.<span>&#0160; </span>What your<br /> company does for a living has to make a choice.<span>&#0160; </span>And the choice is this: either you break rules or you follow<br /> rules.<span>&#0160; </span>Those are the choices.<span>&#0160; </span>There doesn’t seem to be a lot of<br /> middle ground.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">You can say well mostly we follow the rules, but every once<br /> in a while we break them.<span>&#0160; </span>But if<br /> you say that, really what you’re saying is we follow the rules unless we have<br /> no choice.<span>&#0160; </span>There are people in<br /> this room who I have enormous amounts of respect for who have decided to break<br /> rules.<span>&#0160; </span>And we’ll talk about some<br /> of that later in the day.<span>&#0160; </span>But once<br /> you decide to break rules, then you can make intelligent choices about which<br /> rules to break.<span>&#0160; </span>But if you’ve made<br /> the decision that your job is to follow rules, you don’t get to have the<br /> choice.<span>&#0160; </span>And the only reason I<br /> wrote the book is to get people to make that choice.<span>&#0160; </span>I just want you to pick.<span>&#0160; </span>Break rules or follow the rules.<span>&#0160; </span>Fit in or stand out.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Race to the top or race to the bottom.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And the problem with racing to the bottom is you might<br /> win.<span>&#0160; </span>And if you win the race to<br /> the bottom, that’s where you’re stuck.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Whereas if you race to the top, you might now win but it’s okay because<br /> you’re getting closer all the time.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We talked a little bit about this idea of emotional<br /> labor.<span>&#0160; </span>I’m not sure people really<br /> get the impact of both words, so let me start with the second one.<span>&#0160; </span>Labor means hard.<span>&#0160; </span>I never had a baby, but my guess is<br /> it’s called labor for a reason.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And labor is worth paying for because very few people do it for<br /> fun.<span>&#0160; </span>Emotional is even harder than<br /> physical.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">There are people who voluntarily go for a long run to do the<br /> physical labor on their muscles because they actually like the way it<br /> feels.<span>&#0160; </span>But emotional labor – labor<br /> that makes you want to cry, labor that makes you feel tiny, labor that makes<br /> you feel like a failure, labor that brings up all sorts of fear – really<br /> horrible fear, that same feeling you have about things that you don’t even want<br /> to talk about – it’s difficult to imagine doing that for fun.<span>&#0160; </span>But what has happened to our economy is<br /> that’s all we’re going to get paid for going forward.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">All we’re going to get paid for at American standards.<span>&#0160; </span>There are plenty of ways to get paid $2<br /> an hour, plenty of ways to get paid $4 an hour.<span>&#0160; </span>Mechanical &#8230; will keep you busy all day long for $4 an<br /> hour for the rest of your life.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>But if you want to make $50 an hour, which is $100,000 a year, why would<br /> we pay your for that?<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We don’t need to pay you to type.<span>&#0160; </span>We don’t need to pay you to move widget A to pile B.<span>&#0160; </span>We don’t need to pay you to sit in a<br /> meeting and come up with objections.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>All we need to pay you for is doing this really difficult work. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I have a couple of the bonus items that I want to touch<br /> on.<span>&#0160; </span>This idea of honest signals –<br /> Sandy Pentland wrote a book about it, he does research at MIT – is so important<br /> and again, it’s not a theory, it’s real science, the people have tested and it<br /> works.<span>&#0160; </span>Human beings, like most wild<br /> animals, are extraordinarily good at sensing tiny changes in the<br /> environment.<span>&#0160; </span>And the changes that<br /> we’re the best at sensing are the way other people are feeling.<span>&#0160; </span>That you can look somebody in the eye<br /> and know if they’re afraid.<span>&#0160; </span>You<br /> could look someone in the eye and have a sense as to whether they’re<br /> lying.<span>&#0160; </span>There are some people who<br /> can trick you but generally they can’t.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And so when you meet someone who is truly generous, you can<br /> just tell.<span>&#0160; </span>When you meet someone<br /> who is truly on the team and moving stuff forward, you can just tell.<span>&#0160; </span>When you meet someone who is clearly<br /> trying to slow things down, you can just tell.<span>&#0160; </span>So you can’t fake the things that go into this emotional<br /> labor thing.<span>&#0160; </span>You have to have<br /> chosen before you got there.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>You’ve have to have committed before you got there because people are<br /> going to be able to smell it on you, literally.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">That means that the more interactions we have, particularly<br /> non-digital ones, the more likely it is that people will follow you when they<br /> sense that you’re on the path, that you’re actually making something happen.<br /> The path though, is the problem because you want a map.<span>&#0160; </span>You want someone to say what do I do<br /> next?<span>&#0160; </span>You want someone to say,<br /> “Now do this and now do this and then you win.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If you go to a writer’s conference there’s all these people<br /> paying money to be told step by step how to write a book that hasn’t been<br /> written yet.<span>&#0160; </span>If you go to art<br /> school, there are all these days – days and days and days for money – step by<br /> step on how to paint something that’s never been painted yet.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s no difference between that and coming up with a new<br /> strategy for a textbook.<span>&#0160; </span>There’s<br /> no difference between that and launching an iPad app that changes<br /> everything.<span>&#0160; </span>No one can tell you<br /> how.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">After Twitter hit the curve and became the fastest-growing<br /> communications medium in history, dozens of companies just like Twitter came<br /> along.<span>&#0160; </span>It only takes a week to<br /> program something like Twitter.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>You don’t win any prizes for having the seventh version of Twitter.<span>&#0160; </span>We don’t need that.<span>&#0160; </span>We needed you to do it before when<br /> there was no map.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Many management consultants know about the knowing-doing<br /> gap.<span>&#0160; </span>This is a different kind of<br /> knowing-doing gap.<span>&#0160; </span>The<br /> knowing-doing gap is that someone can read a book, it tells them what the map<br /> is and then they don’t do anything.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>The knowing-doing gap is a manager can say to somebody “I need you to do<br /> these things” and they shake their head and they know it, but they don’t do<br /> them.<span>&#0160; </span>We now have better<br /> understanding about why that is. <span>&#0160;</span>It’s not because the person’s stupid.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s because the person has chosen not<br /> to do it.<span>&#0160; </span>They have chosen not to<br /> do it for only one reason – they’re afraid.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We don’t like saying because we think fear is a different<br /> sort of fear.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s the<br /> nah-nah-nah-you’re-a-chicken fear. And that’s not the kind of fear I’m talking<br /> about.<span>&#0160; </span>I’m talking about the fear<br /> deep down that the lizard brain has for survival.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I went to a business school that used to be called chaos<br /> pilots in Amsterdam a couple weeks ago.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>They stand in a circle before every day and they do something called<br /> “check in.”<span>&#0160; </span>And the way check-in<br /> works is there are 12 people in a circle and it’s silent.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And when you feel like you have something to say about your<br /> day today, your day yesterday, you say it.<span>&#0160; </span>And when you’re done, you say “check out.”<span>&#0160; </span>So you say “Check in.<span>&#0160; </span>I’m really glad to be here today.<span>&#0160; </span>Check out.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And everyone goes around the circle not in order, just when<br /> it occurs to you.<span>&#0160; </span>And we went<br /> through that and it was my turn and I was about ninth and I’m not shy, so I<br /> said, “You know?<span>&#0160; </span>I don’t think you<br /> should call this ‘Check in,’ I think you should call it ‘Chicken’ because what<br /> you’re doing is your’ giving everyone cover to say nothing, and what we really<br /> need to say is ‘this is what I’m afraid of today, this is what I was afraid of<br /> yesterday.’”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If we could honesty say out loud what we’re afraid of, it<br /> turns out that what we’re afraid of isn’t that scary.<span>&#0160; </span>But because we pushed it over there into the closet, it<br /> seems really scary. <span>&#0160;</span>But if we open<br /> the door of the closet, look it in the eye, call it by name, what are we afraid<br /> of?<span>&#0160;&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I’m giving a speech to 12 people.<span>&#0160; </span>I’m petrified.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Why are you petrified?<span>&#0160; </span>They<br /> might not like it.<span>&#0160; </span>Then what would<br /> happen?<span>&#0160; </span>I wouldn’t have to do it<br /> again.<span>&#0160; </span>Okay.<span>&#0160; </span>So can we move on?<span>&#0160; </span>Is it worth staying up all night<br /> worrying about this?<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">You could be afraid of saber tooth tigers – that’s a good<br /> thing to be afraid of.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s even<br /> okay to be afraid of pit bulls.<span>&#0160; </span>It<br /> is not okay to be afraid of giving a speech to 12 people.<span>&#0160; </span>What’s going to happen?<span>&#0160; </span>What’s the worse that could<br /> happen?<span>&#0160; </span>And if you say it out<br /> loud, what you see is this: it’s very easy to describe what will happen if you<br /> stick with the status quo.<span>&#0160; </span>If you<br /> don’t give a speech, ever.<span>&#0160; </span>If you<br /> don’t have a blog, ever.<span>&#0160; </span>If you<br /> don’t put your ideas in front of people, ever.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If you don’t ship ever, then I guarantee what’s going to<br /> happen – you’ll stay here until you get laid off and then you’re going to get<br /> old and then you’re going to die.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The other choice is to build an organization where you have<br /> a platform for people to do art. <span>&#0160;</span>And the price of being in that organization is that you<br /> demand change.<span>&#0160; </span>And this is where<br /> leadership comes in.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">True story.<span>&#0160; </span>I<br /> used to have a company.<span>&#0160; </span>It was 70<br /> people; we were in one big room.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>The New York office had 50 people in one giant room.<span>&#0160; </span>And the rules were every 30 to 90 days;<br /> everyone had to move their desk to sit in a different place.<span>&#0160; </span>And I told people the reason was<br /> because no one should have to sit next to me for too long.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But the real reason is because if you can get over the fear<br /> of moving your desk, then it’s easy to get over the fear of a new business<br /> model, the fear of a new role in the company because you have to go through all<br /> that act of moving stuff.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">About two years into it, I sat down with one of my three<br /> best employees and I said to him, “Look, I’ve been going through what we’ve<br /> been up to, and in the last nine months, you haven’t failed once.<span>&#0160; </span>You haven’t done one thing that didn’t<br /> work.”<span>&#0160; </span>And so I said, “If you<br /> don’t fail soon, you’re fired.”<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And I meant it.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">You can’t have it both ways.<span>&#0160; </span>You can’t say this is an organization that embraces<br /> change.<span>&#0160; </span>This is an organization<br /> that embraces this kind of risk-taking and then rewards and embraces people who<br /> don’t take risks.<span>&#0160;&#0160; </span>You<br /> can’t.<span>&#0160; </span>You have to say the way you<br /> get fired at this company is by doing what you’re told.<span>&#0160; </span>The way you lose your job – the thing I<br /> want you to be the most afraid of is being the least failing person in the<br /> organization.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If we can shift the fear to the fear of not doing art, to<br /> the fear of not standing up to the fear of not running to the top, then guess<br /> what – the lizard becomes your friend.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>It becomes your ally to help you ship.<span>&#0160; </span>If you don’t ship you haven’t done a thing.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s no point in starting if you don’t finish.<span>&#0160; </span>Finish can include quitting halfway<br /> because you’ve done the right analysis.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>But there is no point in starting doing your best and then washing your<br /> hands of it.<span>&#0160; </span>That’s just wasting time.<span>&#0160; </span>Which leads to this thought of<br /> thrashing.<span>&#0160; </span>And we’re going to<br /> spend a bit of time today talking about thrashing as a result as it relates to<br /> shipping.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Every project that ships late ships late for exactly the<br /> same reason.<span>&#0160; </span>So let me tell you<br /> the story of the sequel to Duke Nukem, one of the most successful video games<br /> of all times.<span>&#0160; </span>It made fifty,<br /> hundred, million dollars – something like that.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">A tiny group of people owned all the rights.<span>&#0160; </span>They said we’re going to make the<br /> sequel that’s going to be the best video game ever.<span>&#0160; </span>Six months, ninth months, a year goes by, they’re 80% of the<br /> way there.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Now the team has 30 people on it and the meetings about what<br /> could be done in the last 20% get longer.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>The contributions of what needs to happen before it ships become more<br /> common.<span>&#0160; </span>People say we’re really<br /> close to shipping, so let’s add this feature because it would be a shame to not<br /> have it.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We’re really close to shipping – wait a minute, there’s this<br /> new platform out, let’s make sure that we’ll be supporting that one.<span>&#0160; </span>And it went on and it went on.<span>&#0160; </span>And it was a perfect storm of an example<br /> because they didn’t have a money shortage and there was no person yelling at<br /> them from the other side because it was up to them.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Nine years later, they cancelled the project.<span>&#0160; </span>It got to 80% three times and they<br /> cancelled the project.<span>&#0160; </span>The reason<br /> is simple:<span>&#0160; </span>because of<br /> thrashing.<span>&#0160; </span>That the closer we get<br /> to shipping the louder the lizard brain gets.<span>&#0160; </span>The more the reasons there are to worry. Think about how<br /> often the CEO comes to the meeting.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Does the CEO – does she come at the beginning or she does come<br /> at the end of the process?<span>&#0160; </span>She<br /> comes at the end.<span>&#0160; </span>Why bother<br /> wasting her time, right?<span>&#0160; </span>Think<br /> about when do the lawyers come?<span>&#0160; </span>Do<br /> the lawyers come at the beginning or do they come at the end?<span>&#0160; </span>They come at the end and they say,<br /> “Wait, you can’t do ‘x’.<span>&#0160; </span>Well,<br /> that was something we needed to know six months ago.”<span>&#0160; </span>So the thrashing goes like this and then you don’t ship<br /> because there are too many people and too many connections and too many<br /> objections.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">So how do you ship?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Well, first you decide it’s important to ship.<span>&#0160; </span>If you decide it’s important to ship, you do things in the<br /> right order, you do them with rigor.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>And what you say is the first week of this project is when we’re going<br /> to thrash.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Lawyers, CEO come during the first week or don’t come at<br /> all.<span>&#0160; </span>We can thrash all we want at<br /> the beginning because we haven’t done, we haven’t laid the foundation, we<br /> haven’t ordered the parts, we haven’t built everything.<span>&#0160; </span>Come at the beginning and then you’re not<br /> allowed back in the room.<span>&#0160; </span>You will<br /> not see it again until it’s in the store. You will not see it again until it’s<br /> online.<span>&#0160; </span>You will not see it again<br /> until it’s shipped out the door, so you better come at the beginning and thrash<br /> a lot. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">People say this is unrealistic.<span>&#0160; </span>Well, shipping is unrealistic.<span>&#0160; </span>It is unrealistic to imagine that three or five or fifty<br /> motivated people can make a dent in the universe, but they can.<span>&#0160; </span>And so the way they do it is by taking<br /> the unrealistic act of thrashing at the beginning.<span>&#0160; </span>Who runs your project?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>This is a critical semantic question.<span>&#0160; </span>Are you going to have someone manage the project or run the<br /> project?<span>&#0160; </span>What’s the difference<br /> between managing it and running it?<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Here’s my definition.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Someone who manages a project is a reporter.<span>&#0160; </span>The manager of the project reports to you how things are<br /> going. They report that this person was late.<span>&#0160; </span>They report that that piece didn’t’ work.<span>&#0160; </span>They report that certain environmental<br /> satiations made it so it wouldn’t happen.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>Someone running the project ships.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">A lot of people in your organization don’t want to run<br /> anything because if you run something, you can fail.<span>&#0160; </span>If you manage it, you just report – sorry, it’s out of my<br /> control; I’ve reported everything as it’s happened, nothing I can do about<br /> it.<span>&#0160; </span>But if you run it, then you’re<br /> doing the work because what you are doing is saying to people, “You cannot come<br /> to this meeting because I’m responsible for shipping and if you come, we won’t<br /> ship.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And it’s much easier for the person running to say no to<br /> you, don’t come, than it is to apologize three months later for being<br /> late.<span>&#0160; </span>And that mindset<br /> distinguishes projects that ship from those that don’t.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Okay, so the last thing I want to do is read to you a note I<br /> got.<span>&#0160; </span>The punchline here is<br /> this:<span>&#0160; </span>everything I’ve talked to<br /> you about for the last hour isn’t easy.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>In fact, it’s really hard.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>If you are a musician or a programmer or an accountant and you want to<br /> do art, and your heard everything I just said and you combine it with how<br /> difficult it is to get people in the real world to hear your ideas, how<br /> difficult it is to make a living doing this – it’s very easy to look – and<br /> everything &#8230; that’s really hard.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And my answer is, “So? Why shouldn’t it be hard?”<span>&#0160; </span>We’re talking about winning one of the<br /> biggest games ever.<span>&#0160; </span>We’re talking<br /> about having you impact on whatever universe you live in.<span>&#0160; </span>We’re talking about turning pages that<br /> have never been turned before.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>We’re talking about leaving a legacy behind that you can point to 10 or<br /> 20 or 30 or 40 years later that your kids can point and say, “My mom shipped<br /> that.”<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Why shouldn’t that be hard?<span>&#0160; </span>So here’s the note I got:<span>&#0160; </span>It’s a pretty sobering picture for the future of art.<span>&#0160; </span>Over the last couple of months, as I’ve<br /> neared completion and have had to think more about where I’m going to take this<br /> manuscript, and how I’m going to start establishing myself, the more and more<br /> I’m realizing what a daunting, long-term proposition this is going to be. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If I want to be a person whose main thing is writing, that<br /> is, the difficult part for me is that I’m not sure how to begin building a fan<br /> base, begin cultivating that reputation and necessary connections with people,<br /> which makes me realize that if I personally don’t know where to begin or<br /> continue, I need to find people who can help me.<span>&#0160; </span>But again, a difficult thing to begin.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">We live in a strange world when the process of trying to get<br /> your message or product to people is more time consuming and exhausting than<br /> the actual creation of art itself – the pouring your passion onto canvas or<br /> page.<span>&#0160; </span>I’m interested to know in<br /> what ways the model for the music industry is similar to that of publishing<br /> books.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Still, all this isn’t to turn me from going ahead.<span>&#0160; </span>It’s just making it clear how much hard<br /> work and creativity I’m going to have to put into finding out where my next<br /> buck is going to come from.<span>&#0160; </span>But<br /> I’m glad I’m realizing and beginning to work on this now since I think that<br /> this is the economic future for America – less security, money on the margins,<br /> needing a close network for support, having hands in many different schemes –<br /> that’s not just for artists, that’s the future as a whole.<span>&#0160; </span>Not sure to what extent my generation<br /> understands that though.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">So my mission going forward and the reason I said I have no<br /> plans to write another book is that this is the turning point of our time.<span>&#0160; </span>That the hard work of building the Ford<br /> Motor Company is really hard work.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span>That the hard work of building Prudential Insurance is really hard<br /> work.<span>&#0160; </span>Those were important things<br /> that our parents and our grandparents did.<span>&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The hard work that we have to do is to not use Twitter and<br /> Facebook to entertain ourselves and hide from the art.<span>&#0160; </span>And the hard work that we have to do is<br /> not go to yet another meeting with yet another boring boss who’s going to have<br /> yet another boring project for us to do.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">But the hard work – and we’re seeing it over and over again<br /> in every field I can imagine, not including bringing vaccines to the developing<br /> world – the hard work is to look at the status quo and say, “Well, they built<br /> all these tools for me.<span>&#0160; </span>They built<br /> all this leverage for me, and it’s not here to entertain me, it’s here to<br /> permit me to put myself at risk, to maybe have someone look me in the eye and<br /> say, ‘You’re not good enough to do that.’”<span>&#0160; </span>That’s really hard.<span>&#0160;<br /> </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">And then what we have to do as trainers or as managers or as<br /> people who can spread ideas is somehow put in front of people that what we need<br /> them to do is to solve interesting problems.<span>&#0160; </span>And what we need them to do is lead.<span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>And then if all they’re<br /> prepared to do is make widgets, we have a long slog ahead of us.<span>&#0160; </span>But if we’re wiling to race to the top<br /> and do work that matters, my bet is that a few of us will do it often enough to<br /> actually make change.<span>&#0160; </span>Thank you<br /> for listening to that part, I appreciate it.<span>&#0160; </span>Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">April 27, 2010</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="24254"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">65</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2010/04/transcript-of-the-first-linchpin-session/&title=Transcript of the first Linchpin session"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Transcript of the first Linchpin session+https://seths.blog/2010/04/transcript-of-the-first-linchpin-session/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2010/04/transcript-of-the-first-linchpin-session/&title=Transcript of the first Linchpin session&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2010/04/transcript-of-the-first-linchpin-session/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/powerpoint-makes-us-stupidthese-bullets-can-kill/">&#8220;Powerpoint makes us stupid&#8221;&#8211;these bullets can kill</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5nS" data-title="&#8220;Powerpoint makes us stupid&#8221;&#8211;these bullets can kill"><p>The US Army reports that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/27powerpoint.html">misuse of Powerpoint</a> (in other words, using Powerpoint the way most people use it, the way it was designed to be used) is a huge issue.</p><p>I first wrote a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/really_bad_powe.html">popular short free ebook</a> about this seven years ago and the problem hasn&#39;t gone away.

He hands you a falafel, no onions.</p><p><em>This</em> for <em>that</em>.</p><p>Something for something.</p><p>The time between surrendering the money and getting the sandwich is tiny. You gave him something, you got something. It&#39;s simple.</p><p>Now, stretch it out a bit. You order dinner in a restaurant. They treat you nicely, the room is beautiful, you enjoy the evening, <em>then</em> you pay the bill. This, pause, pause, pause, that.</p><p>Go to law school. Pay a lot of money. Spend a lot of time. Be taught a bunch of things you don&#39;t particularly want to know, things you probably don&#39;t need. Get a degree with a modicum of scarcity. Pay for a bar review course. Pass the bar. Then you get a job that pays a lot of money.</p><p><em>This</em>, then a multi-year pause, then, in return, <em>that</em> for the next forty years. We call it return on investment.</p><p>Online, though, I&#39;m not sure the math is so obvious. You don&#39;t write a blog to get gigs. You don&#39;t help people out in a forum to build a freelance business. Sure, that might happen, but that&#39;s not why you do it. If you are busy calculating quid pro quo, that means your heart isn&#39;t in it, and the math won&#39;t work out anyway.</p><p>Online, the something, the quid, the <em>this</em>, doesn&#39;t cost cash. It takes heart and energy and caring, which are scarce but renewable resources. As a result, many people are able to spend them without seeking anything external in return. Even better, the act of generosity, of giving without expectation, makes it easier to do art, to create work that matters on its own.</p><p>I think it&#39;s more like Santa math. Santa flies around the world, giving stuff away, and for what? He earns gratitude, trust and friendship, that&#39;s what. Sure, one day he might decide to license his image or try to sell you something. But right here, right now, gratitude, trust and friendship are plenty. Especially if you enjoy doing what you&#39;re doing. Quid, no quo.</p></div><p class="byline"> <span class="date">April 26, 2010</span></p><div class="post-footer"><div id="star-the-post" class="stp" data-postid="20702"> <i class="stp--icon"></i> <i class="stp--outline"></i> <span class="stp--count">262</span></div><ul class="social-icons"><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://seths.blog/2010/04/quid-pro-quo/&title=Quid pro quo (santa math)"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_facebook.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Quid pro quo (santa math)+https://seths.blog/2010/04/quid-pro-quo/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_twitter.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-social-share" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://seths.blog/2010/04/quid-pro-quo/&title=Quid pro quo (santa math)&source=https://seths.blog"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_linkedin.svg" /></a></li><li><a class="js-copy-url" data-clipboard-text="https://seths.blog/2010/04/quid-pro-quo/"><img class="svg" src="https://seths.blog/wp-content/themes/godin/img/socialshare_link.svg" /></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="https://seths.blog/2010/04/empty-your-library/">Empty your library</a></h2><div class="has-content-area" data-url="https://wp.me/p9XDcM-5nV" data-title="Empty your library"><p>If you&#39;ve read one of my books, thanks.
